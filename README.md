This project has helped me perfect my knowledge on:

- Manipulation and storage of data.
- [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) files and format.
- HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
- Event creation and display.
- [Client-server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Client-Server_overview).

### Overview

This was an app I created in order to improve upon my knowledge of APIs.

- The API I've used for this app consists of four parts:

  - The first one, `artists`, contains information about some bands and artists like their name, image, the year they founded, the date of their first album and their members.

  - The second one, `locations`, contains their most recent and/or upcoming concert locations.

  - The third one, `dates`, contains their most recent and/or upcoming concert dates.

  - And the last one, `relation`, links between all the other parts (`artists`, `dates` and `locations`).

- Using this information, I have built a user friendly website where I have displayed the bands' info through the use of cards as data visualizations.

### Specific Details

- The frontend is written in **HTML, CSS & JavaScript**.
- The backend is written in **Go**.
- I have handled all site and server bugs/errors to avoid crashes.

### In order to limit myself...

- I have used only the [standard Go](https://golang.org/pkg/) packages.
