Welcome to the Artist Tour Website, a web application designed to provide information about artists and their tours. I have delevoped this web application to have a user-friendly interface and to use visually appealing data visualization.

This project was created to improve upon my knowledge of APIs, data manipulation, client-server communication, and event creation and display. To achieve this goal, I utilized a custom API that consists of four parts:

- The artists endpoint contains information about bands and artists, including their name, image, year of formation, first album release date, and members.
- The locations endpoint contains information about the locations of recent and upcoming concerts for these artists.
- The dates endpoint contains information about the dates of these recent and upcoming concerts.
- The relation endpoint links together the information from the other three endpoints, allowing for a comprehensive view of an artist's tour.

Using this information, I built a website that displays artist information through the use of cards as data visualizations. The frontend of the website is written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, while the backend is written in Go. I also handled all site and server errors to prevent any crashes.

To keep the scope of this project manageable, I limited myself to using only the standard Go packages. However, this did not hinder my ability to create a fully functional and visually appealing web application.

### Project Focus
- Manipulation and storage of data.
- [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) files and format.
- HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
- Event creation and display.
- [Client-server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Client-Server_overview).

### Usage

- To run this app, simply clone the repository, run main.go, and head to localhost:3000 in your web browser. From there, you can browse through the available artists and view their tour information. I hope you enjoy exploring the Artist Tour Website as much as I enjoyed creating it.
